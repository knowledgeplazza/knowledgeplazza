# Knowledge Plazza
The Wizzard Lizzard's 2017 CodeTN Project  

Run `npm run build` and `npm start` to get started

__Notes for cloud9__
You must run `npm run app:build:c9` or `npm run build:c9` to tell the app to load data from the c9 workspace
Building the app takes forever on cloud9, so you might want to just skip building
